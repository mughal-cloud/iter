*Overview*

Iter command program yields one command at a time along with other metadata. This includes line number, command start line, and command number. This program is designed to ignore comments found in a script. 

*Bug found:* Commented lines are also itered along with commands when they should not be.

Tests can be executed with this command: `make tests`
